This is a C++ program that simulates a hotel booking system. The program displays a menu of hotels for the user to choose from and allows them to select a room type and number of nights. The program then calculates the cost of the room, including taxes, and generates a receipt for the booking. The program also saves the receipt to a text file named "OutCIM.txt". The program uses functions, control flow, and file I/O in C++ to achieve its functionality. It also uses constant variables to store the percentage of taxes applied to the room booking. The program allows the user to make multiple bookings and exit the program when they are done.
